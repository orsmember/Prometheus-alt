In its operations, a bank is exposed or may be exposed to the following risks in particular: \n \n1) liquidity risk;  \n2) credit risk, including residual risk, dilution risk, settlement/delivery risk and counterparty risk; \n3) interest rate risk; \n4) foreign exchange risk and other market risks; \n5) concentration risk, which particularly includes risks of exposure of the bank to one person or a group of related persons; \n6) investment risks; \n7) risks relating to the country of origin of the entity to which a bank is exposed (country risk); \n8) operational risk, which particularly includes legal risk; \n9) risk of compliance of the banks operations; \n \t \t9a) risk of money laundering and terrorist financing;   \t \t10) strategic risk;  \t \t11) other risks. \n \n  For the purposes of this Decision, risks referred to herein shall have the following meaning: \n \n \n1) residual risk is the likelihood of occurrence of adverse effects on financial result and banks capital due to the fact that credit risk mitigation techniques are less efficient than anticipated or their implementation does not have sufficient influence on the reduction of risks to which the bank is exposed; \n2) dilution risk is the possibility of occurrence of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital due to the reduced value of purchased receivables as a result of cash or non-cash liabilities of the former creditor to the borrower; \n3) settlement/delivery risk is the possibility of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital arising from unsettled transactions or counterpartys failure to deliver in free delivery transactions on the due delivery date; \n4) counterparty credit risk is the possibility of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital arising from counterpartys failure to fulfil his part of the deal in a transaction before final settlement of cash flows of the transaction or settlement of monetary liabilities under that transaction;   5) risk of compliance of the banks business activities is the possibility of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital as a consequence of failure to comply its operation with law and other regulation, operating standards, procedures for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and other procedures, and other rules governing operation of banks, and in particular encompasses the risk of sanctions by the regulatory authority, risk of financial losses and reputational risk; \n6) strategic risk is the possibility of adverse effects on the banks financial result or capital due to absence of adequate policies and strategies, or due to their inadequate implementation, and due to changes in the environment in which the bank operates or failure of the bank to adequately respond to these changes; \n7) legal risk is the risk of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital arising from court or out-of-court proceedings relating to the banks operation (contracts and torts, labour relations, etc.).  \n \nII.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edfd19ba-f51f-4e31-bbd1-8a6f4d39cc8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "edfd19ba-f51f-4e31-bbd1-8a6f4d39cc8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d56f76e9-6b3c-4f42-9684-3aa299137c79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a906e460424124809e01d4386a17be3c051729ff776d0f7aba0fcc809d46233"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bfd150c-6bc0-4dae-9bf8-6c6505b2d08f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58b8df72d08f944bbab55cb0924ba1ef7094fe4fb11c41c5d71c8d3126c265ee"}}, "hash": "5eb69559746d9228d0c971fa28231cb0bcc774f027f107a9b2179f47e766f9f7", "text": "banks operation (contracts and torts, labour relations, etc.).  \n \nII. ESTABLISHING RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF A BANK \n \n3. A bank shall establish a comprehensive and reliable system of risk management, integrated in all its business activities, which ensures that the banks risk profile is always in line with the already established propensity to risks and tolerance to risks. The risk management system must be proportionate to the nature, volume and complexity of the banks operations and/or its risk profile. \n \n  The risk management system within the meaning of paragraph 1 hereof shall be considered comprehensive and reliable if it enables the bank to manage risks it is or may be exposed to in connection with its business activities. \n \n  The risk management system within the meaning of paragraph 1 hereof shall be considered integrated in all business activities of the bank if the bank makes every business decision where it assumes certain risks (including conditions under which certain transactions are negotiated) taking into consideration prior assessment by employees in charge of risk management. \n \n  Business activities referred to in paragraph 1 hereof shall also imply activities undertaken by third parties on behalf of the bank (outsourcing). \n \n  The risk profile of the bank referred to in paragraph 1 hereof shall imply assessment of the bank regarding the structure and level of all risks it is or may be exposed to in its operation. \n \n  The banks propensity to risks referred to in paragraph 1 hereof shall imply the risk level that the bank intends to assume in order to accomplish its strategies and policies, while tolerance to risks referred to in that paragraph shall imply the maximum acceptable risk level. The bank shall ensure that its propensity to risks and tolerance to risks are in line with the banks strategic planning period. \n \n \t4. The risk management system shall encompass: \n \n strategy, policies and procedures for risk management, i.e. for the identification, measurement, assessment, monitoring, control and mitigation of risks and reporting on them; \n adequate internal organisation/organisational structure of the bank; \n effective and efficient process of management of all risks the bank is or may be exposed to in its operation;    adequate internal controls system; \n appropriate information system; \n adequate internal capital adequacy assessment process. \n \nStrategy, policies and procedures \n5.

A bank shall continuously implement the documented internal capital adequacy assessment process commensurate with the nature, volume and complexity of the banks activities, in accordance with the risk management strategy and policies and with the capital management strategy. \n \n  A bank shall ensure that the process referred to in paragraph 1 hereof also meets the following conditions: \n \n it is based on risk identification and measurement and/or assessment; \n it ensures a comprehensive risk", "start_char_idx": 26297, "end_char_idx": 30959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef2b2b68-4378-4eac-8f1b-0d13bc01abcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef2b2b68-4378-4eac-8f1b-0d13bc01abcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0223ec54-8e40-4c3e-b067-5fef2710aac7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c727e11531ee82c29d562f5e117fa04626360cdfee3402db852de28f0501a3ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff850586-8c54-448d-b9d8-b7b6d180688b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3762ddc6f9c8986b639199f3f3ba484f22d37cab5b4c462fe21e30b8c4948d96"}}, "hash": "5758febecd5c753a63bd62a6adf49fc70db4283749d75526905f59c971c29150", "text": "and measurement and/or assessment; \n it ensures a comprehensive risk assessment, and monitoring of materially significant risks the bank is or may be exposed to in its operation;    it ensures adequate available internal capital in accordance with the banks risk profile; \n it is adequately incorporated into the banks management and decision-making system; \n it is subject to regular analyses, monitoring and checking. \n \nPhases of the process \n \n23. A bank shall ensure that the internal capital adequacy assessment process encompasses the following phases: \n \n1) identification of materially significant risks; \n2) calculation of internal capital requirements for individual risks;  \t \t3) determination of total internal capital requirements;   \t \t4) comparison of the following elements: \n capital calculated in accordance with the decision on capital adequacy of banks and the amount of available internal capital;  \n minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with \nthe above decision and internal capital requirements for individual risks; \n sum of minimum capital requirements calculated in accordance with the above decision and total internal capital requirements. \n \n24. A bank shall adopt an appropriate internal regulation setting out quantitative and qualitative criteria, and the thresholds based on which it identifies materially significant risks to be included in the internal capital adequacy assessment process, taking into consideration the type, volume and complexity of its activities, as well as the specific features of the markets in which it operates. \n \n  To identify risks referred to in paragraph 1 hereof, a bank shall analyse: \n \n1) risks for which it calculates minimum capital requirements, in \nconformity with the decision on capital adequacy of banks; \n2) risks that are not fully encompassed by minimum capital requirements in provision 1) hereof (credit-foreign exchange risk, residual risk, possible underestimation of credit risk due to the application of standardised approach, possible underestimation of operational risk due to the application of the base rate approach or standardised approach and/or alternative standardised approach); \n3) liquidity risk, interest rate risk, concentration risk, reputational risk and strategic risk; \n4) risks arising from external factors, including the impact of the business and macroeconomic environment, as well as risks not mentioned in provisions 1)3) hereof. \n \n  For the purposes of the internal capital adequacy assessment process, the bank may use its own definitions of risk that include at least the definitions of risk in accordance with this decision and the decision governing capital adequacy of banks, whereby it shall explain in detail any differences in definitions and document them appropriately. \n \n  A bank shall provide a documented explanation of its decision not to include certain risks in its internal capital adequacy assessment process. \n \n25.

RISK MANAGEMENT BY BANKS \n \nCredit risk \n \n38. Credit risk is the possibility of occurrence of adverse effects on financial result and capital of the bank caused by the borrowers failure to fulfil its obligations to the bank. \n \n  A bank shall manage credit risk at the level of individual loan and at the level of the entire credit portfolio. \n \n  In order to assume credit risk and manage that risk, a bank shall establish an adequate credit process, which shall include the process of loan approval and the process of managing this risk. \n \n39. Within the credit process, a bank shall establish: \n \n1) criteria and principles for approving new loans and for extending forbearance in respect of existing loans, and particularly for deciding on the approval of loans representing large exposures of the bank; \n2) rules for approving and monitoring loans at the level of individual borrowers and credit protection providers, at the level of a group of entities related with them and at the level of entities related with the bank, in accordance with the loan amount and risk degree; \n3) a set of possible forbearance measures to be applied in respect of loans considered distressed assets (for each segment), while at the same time ensuring that forbearance measures may not be used for temporary or permanent concealment of the actual degree of the risk of forborne exposures; \n4) a set of activities to be undertaken in order to reduce the total amount of FX-indexed dinar and FX loans which are not hedged against exchange rate risk resulting from the currency mismatch between the currency of the borrowers income and the currency of the loan. \n \n   Within the meaning of this Decision,", "start_char_idx": 35490, "end_char_idx": 39943, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a01055aa-a155-464b-a8f6-0d874b75fc8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a01055aa-a155-464b-a8f6-0d874b75fc8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff850586-8c54-448d-b9d8-b7b6d180688b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3762ddc6f9c8986b639199f3f3ba484f22d37cab5b4c462fe21e30b8c4948d96"}, "3": {"node_id": "e88a3e97-4ac4-4525-99f3-79c5eff59da5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "90ea39487331ca8cb10b16b63d75b00e3db28eb9c067797c2a3529fceb8752de"}}, "hash": "e01bfb4f62b345d7021d0ebb3088a9a7196441bda2182ed8474664b0d47fc9c9", "text": "and the currency of the loan. \n \n   Within the meaning of this Decision, hedging against exchange rate risk resulting from the currency mismatch between the currency of the borrowers income and the currency of the loan means a natural hedge and financial hedge. A natural hedge exists if the borrowers income and his loan commitment are in the same currency, and financial hedge exists if a bank concludes an appropriate contract with the borrower. \n  \n40. Before deciding to approve a loan, a bank shall assess the borrowers financial standing and creditworthiness, as well as the value and legal security of its credit protection and other relevant factors.  \n \n  If a bank approves a loan under the conditions differing from market conditions, it shall establish procedures for approving and monitoring such loan and for undertaking relevant measures to mitigate credit risk arising from such lending. \n \n41. A bank shall assess credit risk based on quantitative and qualitative criteria which take into consideration the characteristics of the specific borrower and lending and enable clear classification of lending into respective risk categories according to the degree of collectibility. A bank shall ensure continuous monitoring and verification of the adequacy of the classification of loans into these categories. \n \n  When determining the amount of allowances for impairment of balance-sheet assets and provisions for losses on off-balance sheet items, a bank shall take into consideration the assessment of credit risk. \n \n \t \tA bank shall clearly document its credit risk assessment. \n42. A bank shall establish efficient monitoring of lending with clearly defined procedures and frequency which enable it to undertake adequate measures to reduce credit risk in due time in case of deterioration of financial standing or creditworthiness of the borrower or credit protection provider, including measures that would provide hedging against exchange rate risk resulting from the currency mismatch between the currency of the borrowers income and the currency of the loan. \n \n      A bank shall establish clearly defined procedures for monitoring of the use of funds approved for the contractually specified purposes, and determine the types of loans in terms of three-digit accounts stipulated by the decision on the chart of accounts and the content of accounts in the chart of accounts for banks, and/or individual loan products from the banks offer, in respect of which the bank will conduct this monitoring. \n \n      The bank shall document monitoring of the use of funds approved for the contractually specified purposes within the meaning of paragraph 3 of this Section, on the basis of an individual loan approved to the borrower. \n \n  Monitoring of the quality of lending at the level of individual borrower by the bank shall primarily be based on the provision of up-to-date data on the borrowers financial standing and creditworthiness and on the market value of collateral. A bank shall monitor the fulfilment of contractual obligations by the borrower, and particularly the use of funds approved for the contractually specified purposes. \n \n  A bank shall establish the system of early warning for increased credit risk, which enables timely identification of borrowers with whom this increase occurred and which includes the definition of qualitative and quantitative indicators for early detection of increased credit risk. \n \n  A bank shall monitor lending from the time it is approved until the termination of the contract under which the bank is exposed to credit risk, and shall include monitoring of individual lending, borrower and credit protection instruments. In addition to regular monitoring, a bank shall particularly monitor all lending approved to borrowers who are in the status of default. \n \n  To ensure more efficient management of distressed assets, the bank shall carry out the segmentation of these assets based on clear criteria (e.g. exposure to legal and natural persons, purpose of lending, business branches, related persons, currency, collection phase, types of collateral etc.)  in accordance with the scope, type and complexity of the activities it performs, the risk profile of the bank and the level of its distressed assets. 42a.

For loans negotiated in a foreign currency or in dinars with a foreign currency clause, a bank shall assess credit FX risk, i.e. the effect of change in the dinar exchange rate on the borrowers financial standing and creditworthiness, and shall in particular analyse the adequacy of the borrowers cash flows relative to the changed level of credit liabilities, under the assumption that certain changes in the dinar exchange rate will occur at the annual level.  \n \n      Based on the results of the assessment and analysis of the adequacy the borrowers cash flows from paragraph 1 of this Section, the bank shall, in accordance with its internal acts, consider activities and measures which it may propose to the borrower in order to provide hedging against exchange rate risk resulting from the currency mismatch between the currency of the borrowers income and the currency of the loan.  \n \n      The bank shall document the results of the assessment", "start_char_idx": 48824, "end_char_idx": 53138, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c28a36a6-7405-410f-ae1b-345b35df242e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c28a36a6-7405-410f-ae1b-345b35df242e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "e75e457f-e36a-46f1-8cfc-674ccbfa5c33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f3f0f8f2d4f0b289862a09d54114e4ea7c349c5d8664440b070217d154ffb33"}, "3": {"node_id": "a775f4b5-24e9-4433-a9e7-7b76438a905d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab7a9940e0f4452c3041e765b5959de058a470c79e81e2bcad1bfd1e58cff69b"}}, "hash": "bf07ba01e95de0ad527323970336010c9745c23230c516a62b4bde99549a53cd", "text": " \n \n      The bank shall document the results of the assessment including the adequacy of cash flows analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Section, as well as the proposals made to the borrower within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Section. \n \nMonitoring the quality of collateral and work of persons engaged in collateral valuation \n \n 44a. The bank shall define in its internal regulations the types of collateral whose value shall be determined based on the valuation by an authorised valuer, the procedure of obtaining such valuation, the frequency of monitoring the quality of collateral, and/or re-valuation and the manner of determining the expected time of collection by collateral realisation.  \n \n       The authorised valuer referred to in paragraph 1 hereof means the person who  in accordance with the law governing the profession of real estate valuers, and/or the law governing the conditions for expertise  is authorised to conduct valuation of a particular type of collateral, whereas this person may not be related to the borrower within the meaning of the Law on Banks, and may not be involved in the process of loan approval or sale of collateral. \n \n   The bank shall envisage a higher frequency of monitoring the value of collateral and/or obtaining a re-valuation in respect of receivables considered distressed assets and collateral obtained through foreclosure. \n \n   By its internal regulations referred to in paragraph 1 hereof, the bank shall define haircuts by the type of collateral, whereby the estimated market value of collateral is reduced to the expected value to be collected by collateral realisation in the future, taking account of the volatility of such market value, the possibility to realise such collateral and cash flows in respect of costs of its activation and sale (e.g. estimated court expense, taxes incurred by the seller, expenses of consultants, advertising and other costs), the expected decline in the market value from the moment of valuation to the moment of planned realisation, and inherent valuation uncertainty. The bank shall regularly examine the haircuts in accordance with the changes in market conditions. \n \n   The bank shall ensure that its information system contains timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed information and data relating to collateral, to be able to make appropriate business decisions and efficiently manage the risks that it is exposed to in its operation. \n \n 44b. In regard to the selection of authorised valuers, the bank shall define in its internal regulations the criteria which relate to their impartiality, competence and integrity and which are consistent with the basic criteria laid down by the regulations governing the profession of valuers and internationally recognised standards in the field. \n \n   The bank shall establish and update at least once a year its own list of eligible authorised valuers, particularly mindful of whether in earlier valuations they applied international standards of valuation of real estate and other collateral, the accuracy of their earlier valuations (if applicable) and whether a penalty or other measure was pronounced in respect of some of them.  \n \n   For the needs of an individual valuation, the bank shall define the duties and responsibilities of authorised valuers by the guidelines for carrying out valuation and preparation of the valuation report, and shall obtain from him a written statement whereby he confirms that he is familiar and agrees with such duties and responsibilities, that he is not in the conflict of interest (which particularly implies his participation in / ownership of property being valued and/or participation in the sale, lease or acquisition of such property in the name of the banks client), and that  in case of real estate valuation, he shall fully and consistently comply with regulations governing the profession of real estate valuers and international standards in the field of real estate valuation. \n \n   The bank shall determine by its internal regulations the standard contents of the valuation report in accordance with the recognised standards of collateral valuation, which must contain in particular the assumptions used to establish the value of such collateral, the method of assessing its market value and the explanation of the choice of such method, data on a potential or oncoming change in the purpose of collateral (if", "start_char_idx": 53142, "end_char_idx": 57584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a775f4b5-24e9-4433-a9e7-7b76438a905d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a775f4b5-24e9-4433-a9e7-7b76438a905d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c28a36a6-7405-410f-ae1b-345b35df242e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf07ba01e95de0ad527323970336010c9745c23230c516a62b4bde99549a53cd"}, "3": {"node_id": "28859d9a-9162-48af-95f7-48c27d437c27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3220b2dfb37e6621fbc424985ec49ce5f138f4f88adcec128aadfb6a166c2185"}}, "hash": "ab7a9940e0f4452c3041e765b5959de058a470c79e81e2bcad1bfd1e58cff69b", "text": "such method, data on a potential or oncoming change in the purpose of collateral (if applicable), the trend of market price movements and marketability of such collateral. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate risk \n \n45. Interest rate risk is a risk of possible adverse effects on the financial result and capital of the bank arising from positions in the non-trading book due to changes in interest rates. \n \n \t \tA bank shall manage various forms of interest risk as follows: \n \n risk of temporal discrepancy between maturity and new price determination (repricing risk); \n yield curve risk to which it is exposed due to change in the shape of yield curve; \n basis risk to which it is exposed due to different reference interest rates in interest-sensitive positions with similar characteristics regarding maturity or repricing;  \n optionality risk, to which it is exposed due to contract provisions regarding interest-sensitive positions (loans with an early repayment option, deposits with an early withdrawal option, etc.). \n \n46. A bank shall: \n \n establish and appropriately document the process of measuring and/or assessment of interest risk, which includes major sources of interest risk; \n\ndepending on the structure and complexity of the non-trading \nbook, define input data (interest rates, maturities, repricing, embedded options, etc.) to ensure as precise presentation as possible of changes in the economic value or financial result of the bank; \n determine assumptions for the conversion of positions of the nontrading book into cash flows, which are documented and consistently implemented, whereby all major changes of assumptions should be documented and explained and approved by the banks managing board;  \t \t carry out stress tests of the effects of changes in interest rates at least once a year. \n \n47. When determining exposure to the interest rate risk in the non-trading book and limit of this risk, a bank shall assess adverse effects of changes in this rate on the banks financial result (profit and loss account) and the economic value of the bank. \n \n  Economic value of the bank, within the meaning of this Decision, shall be the net present value of all anticipated cash flows of the bank which is equal to the present value of expected cash flows from bank assets less present value of expected cash flows arising from the banks liabilities, adjusted by net present value of expected cash flows arising from the banks off-balance sheet items. \n \n 47a. A bank shall, within the assessment of interest rate risk in the nontrading book, assess the impact of a standardised interest rate shock (200 basis point parallel positive and negative shock on the reference yield curve).  \n \n   The bank shall assess the impact of a standardised interest rate shock for every major currency individually and for all other currencies combined. \n \n   A currency shall be considered major within the meaning of paragraph 2 hereof if the total amount of liabilities from the banks balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities based on which payments by the bank may occur, which is expressed and settled in that currency, makes up 5% or more than 5% of the total amount of the banks liabilities. \n \n   When assessing interest rate risk in the non-trading book, a bank shall also carry out stress tests of the effects of interest rate changes, in conformity with the nature and level of risks it is exposed to. \n \nMarket risks \n \n 48. Market risks shall imply the possibility of occurrence of adverse effects on the banks financial result and capital due to changes in the value of balance-sheet positions and off-balance sheet items arising from changes of prices in the market. \n \n  Market risks shall include foreign exchange risk, price risk on debt securities, price risk on equity securities and commodity risk, in accordance with the decision on capital adequacy of banks.  \n \nNegotiating transactions \n \n 49. A bank shall designate employees authorised to negotiate market transactions, type and limits of transactions which every employee shall be authorised to negotiate on behalf and for the account of the bank, manner of negotiating transactions as well as reporting on negotiated transactions.  \n \n  Each negotiated transaction shall be recorded and all relevant information relating to that transaction shall be adequately documented and forwarded to persons responsible for market risk management. \n \n  The bank shall ensure that", "start_char_idx": 57562, "end_char_idx": 62017, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28859d9a-9162-48af-95f7-48c27d437c27": {"__data__": {"id_": "28859d9a-9162-48af-95f7-48c27d437c27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "997c95f9-3996-4dde-881a-f7e043e4c091", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8586e856624153318a10b6612e76b457ce8e88c9d5cf5d3f3ea93f23af6f71f"}, "2": {"node_id": "a775f4b5-24e9-4433-a9e7-7b76438a905d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab7a9940e0f4452c3041e765b5959de058a470c79e81e2bcad1bfd1e58cff69b"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c0c9de4-952b-4552-bdf6-e17447fc0b11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d7ad9e02cd4fd6e07862c1c6ce26aa3da59793582f8c115e0db8ad7760ef0e8"}}, "hash": "3220b2dfb37e6621fbc424985ec49ce5f138f4f88adcec128aadfb6a166c2185", "text": "forwarded to persons responsible for market risk management. \n \n  The bank shall ensure that the organisational unit in charge of undertaking market risks discharges these tasks only on the banks business premises and shall ensure the control of transactions relating to the assumption of these risks.
